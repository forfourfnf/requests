# Hello!

So basically this is where i will take requests to put in a mod you may like! Create a new issue and request a mod you want me to put in!

# Exceptions

If it's a mod about a creepypasta or 18+ content such as gore, s#x, and anything else that reveals too much, I'm not taking it. Like for example:
Mario's Madness
Sonic.exe
I'm not taking those requests no matter how much of a banger they are

"But FNF is not for kids"

I know that, but as long as it dosen't show too much, then i'll look into it and consider putting it in.

# Notes

1: If you send me a request on another one of my repositories, I will ignore it. You have to send mod requests HERE. If there is an ACTUAL issue about things such as the songs not loading, or it crashed, send in an issue at that repository and i'll see what's wrong with it.

2: Not all songs will be accurate to the original mod. I've tried to put in a modchart and it won't trigger. So unless you guys help me figure out a way of how to resolve that problem, modcharts won't happen.

3: If you DO want it to be accurate to the original mod, Please tell me how to port fnf mods to html5 and i might actually have that in.

4: If an issue is closed, that means that i have that request in and finished it.

With all that out of the way,
